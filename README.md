# 👋 Hi, I'm Sandesh (@tensorsofthewall)

I'm a research engineer working on large-scale multimodal AI systems that see, reason, and operate under real-world constraints. My work spans computer vision, vision-language models, reinforcement learning, distributed training, and more recently, music/audio modeling.  

I enjoy building systems that move beyond benchmarks — from autonomous navigation to distributed inference pipelines — and occasionally making robots smarter (or at least slightly less confused).
