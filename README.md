# üëã Hi, I'm Sandesh (@tensorsofthewall)

I'm a software engineer and AI researcher passionate about building intelligent systems and meaningful technology. My experience spans computer vision, reinforcement learning, generative AI, and more recently, music/audio. I enjoy collaborating on research, developing real-world applications, and occasionally making robots smarter (or at least funnier).
